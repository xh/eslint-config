# Hoist eslint-config

A shareable set of [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configurations with XH's coding conventions and best practices
for Hoist React based development.

Due to limitations of how ESLint's `extends` directive works, this needs to be built and published as its own
dedicated package. See <https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs>.
